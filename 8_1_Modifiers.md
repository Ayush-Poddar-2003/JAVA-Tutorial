# Access Modifiers

For classes, you can use either public or default:

- public:	The class is accessible by any other class  
- default: The class is only accessible by classes in the same package  
- private: The code is only accessible within the declared class  
- protected	The code is accessible in the same package and subclasses

# Non Access Modifiers
- Final: If you don't want the ability to override existing attribute values
- Static: Belongs to the complete class, can use without object
- An abstract method is always inside abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass.
