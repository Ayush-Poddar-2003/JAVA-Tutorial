# OOPS

Why ?  
Readibility, Reusability, DRY

OOPs : Object oriented programming  
{S: System/Structure-Real life like inheritence, inddpendant of language}

### CLASS ?
Blueprint/Template for object, Name always capital

```
class Myclass
{
    ~ data members/Attributes/Properties/Fields  
    ~ member functions//Methods/Behaviour

    psvm{

    }
}
```
---
### OBJECT ?
Real life entity, An instance of a class.  
When objects are created they inherit all the variables and methods from the class.  

`className objectName = new className()`   
new => Allocates memory to object  
className() => constructor
